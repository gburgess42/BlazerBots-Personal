# BlazerBots-Personal
Personal Repository for BlazerBots related work.

This is basically abandoned, but it was primarily created to act as a personal offshoot of the FRC 2020 Infinite Recharge game 
robot code created by the 3807 Overland Blazerbots robotics team. Aka the code that I helped create while I was a member of 3807.
I really only made this because I wanted to be able to continue editing/planning/reading/whatever the robot code even outside of
official robotics meetings. I made it, used it for a brief time, and then completely forgot it's existence. One day I was 
bored as hell and had more time than I knew what to do with, so I rediscovered this and decided to
write a description for it. Anyways that's the story of my life.

Oh and for the record (even though it's probably relatively obvious), this code is outdated as hell. Unless on the unlikely
chance I update this repo's code after writing this.
